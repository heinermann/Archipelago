## Commands
While playing the multiworld you can interact with the server using various commands listed in the 
[commands guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en). As this game does not have an in-game text client at the moment,
You can optionally connect to the multiworld using the text client, which can be found in the 
[main Archipelago installation](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) as Archipelago Text Client to
enter these commands.
