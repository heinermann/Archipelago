## Configuring your YAML File

### What is a YAML and why do I need one?
You can see the [basic multiworld setup guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) here on the Archipelago website to learn
about why Archipelago uses YAML files and what they're for.

### Where do I get a YAML?
You can use the [game settings page for Diablo II](/games/Diablo2/player-settings) here on the Archipelago website to
generate a YAML using a graphical interface.
